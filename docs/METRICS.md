# Metrics

A summary of the metrics the Price Alerts extension will record.


## Definitions

* **Fathom**: A [JavaScript framework](https://github.com/erikrose/fathom) used to extract product information from a Product Page.
* **Product Page**: A webpage ([example](https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fantastic-Beasts-Grindelwald-Grindelwalds/dp/B07BKQXCZR/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1538418041&sr=1-3-spons&keywords=legos&psc=1)) displaying a single product that the user could purchase online.
* **Extraction**: The process of extracting the necessary product information from a Product Page using one of two methods: Fathom or fallback (CSS selectors or Open Graph attributes).
* **Product Card**: A list item in the list of tracked products for which the user has opted to receive Price Alerts displayed on the browserAction popup. Each Product Card displays the product title, image and price.
* **Survey**: a short survey collecting user feedback.
* **Onboarding Popup**: The popup displayed when the user has zero products tracked, including the first time the popup is opened.


## Analysis

Data collected by the Price Alerts extension will be used to answer the following questions:

### User Engagement

- Is the Price Alerts experience compelling?
  - How often do users set price alerts?
  - Do alerts cause users to re-engage with our shopping feature?
  - How often do they respond to price alerts?
  - At what threshold do users respond to price changes?
  - How do users respond when they receive a price alert?
    - Do they click through to the product page?
      - In what intervals?
      - In what circumstances?
  - How often are UI elements used?
  - What are users' tolerance for inaccuracy?
  - Are alerts annoying to users?
  - How often do users keep alerts?
  - How often do users delete alerts?
  - How much time passes before the "set alert" button is available in the drop down?
- Where do users use Price Alerts?
  - For what kinds of products?
  - Which sites do users track products on most?
  - What's the price distribution of products users track?


### Experiment Health

- Can users be compelled to report positive experiences as well as negative ones?
- How often are products detected on supported product pages? (#125)
- How often is Fathom recognizing products on a page? (#125)
- On which sites do users report the most problems?
- How often do product prices change, irrespective of user action?
- How many price alerts are received?
  - In what intervals?


### Performance

There are open questions about whether and how much Fathom may affect page performance. Time permitting, we may ask:

- What is the frame rate for a page while Fathom is running? (#124)


### Questions to answer in future experiments

Answering these questions requires controlled A/B testing or more extensive data collection.

- Does our feature increase shopping browsing?
- Does our feature increase shopping purchase?
- Which sites do users browse on the most?
- On what sites do users shop?

## Sample Pings

We will be sending pings using [Event Telemetry](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/collection/events.html) via the [WebExtensions Telemetry API](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1280234).

Each event will exist as part of the `main` ping, under `payload.processes.dynamic.events` as an array. Below is a sample ping for the `badge_toolbar_button` event:

```json
{
  "type": "main",
  // ...
  "payload": {
    // ...
    "processes": {
      // ...
      "dynamic": {
        // ...
        "events": [
          [
            618573,
            "extension.price_alerts",
            "badge_toolbar_button",
            "toolbar_button",
            null,
            {
              "badge_type": "add"
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
